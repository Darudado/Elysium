# Types: WEAPON,SHIP,RESOURCE,CUSTOM,ACTION_TOOLTIP,ASTEROID,PLANET,SHIP_SYSTEM,FACTION,TERRAIN
elysium,FACTION,"An ancient, space-faring civilization with a distinctly elven appearance, the Elysium combine advanced biotechnology with spiritual traditions. Their ships, constructed from a self-healing, wooden-like living armor, excel in energy-based combat. The organic nature of their vessels makes them incompatible with conventional shield technology, though their remarkable regenerative capabilities compensate for this weakness.","The Elysium emerged from the Collapse relatively unscathed, having isolated themselves in two densely populated star systems. After centuries of isolation, recent resource depletion and population pressure have driven them to adopt an aggressive expansionist policy. Their belief in their biological and cultural superiority fuels their conviction that they alone are worthy stewards of the Sector. Their core worlds remain secretive and heavily defended, while their expeditionary fleets probe outward, bringing them into increasing conflict with other powers.",,,"Elysium faction description"
elysium_void,FACTION,"Mysterious invaders.","No information.",,,"Elysium void faction description"
elys_starforgerepair,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Channels the ship's living armor's regenerative properties through a specialized projection system to repair the hull of nearby allied ships.
Automatically targets the most damaged allied ship within range.
Generates hard flux to repair hull.
Pause repair if flux levels become dangerous.","The Elysium living armor's remarkable self-healing properties were eventually weaponized as support technology. By catalyzing and projecting the regenerative resin through specialized emitters, Elysium support vessels can repair their allies in the heat of battle.",,,
elys_sensoryboost,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Temporarily stimulates the ship's living armor to produce specialized sensory filaments, enhancing the ship's sensor capabilities and boosting its speed.
","Elysium engineers discovered that their living ship armor could be temporarily stimulated to grow sensory filaments that detect subtle spatial disturbances. These sensory enhancements also synchronize with the ship's engines, allowing for brief but significant mobility increases.",,,

Significantly increases ship speed, maneuverability, and weapon cooldown rates temporarily. Creates 4 temporal distorions of the ship that act as decoys.
Generates moderate flux during activation.","Elysium bioscientists discovered that with precise biochemical stimulation, their living ship armor can briefly synchronize its cellular processes to manipulate the fabric of local spacetime. This creates a temporal acceleration field that enhances all ship systems at the cost of significant strain on the armor tissue. The crew will age faster, but for their long lived species it's a small sacrifice.",,,
elys_voidsingularity,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Creates a powerful gravitational singularity at the target location.
Pulls nearby enemy ships toward the center, disrupting their maneuvers.
Vents 40% of current flux when activated.
Singularity power increases with the amount of flux vented.","By channeling excess energy through specialized conduits in the living armor, Elysium warships can create localized distortions in space.
