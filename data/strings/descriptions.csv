# Types: WEAPON,SHIP,RESOURCE,CUSTOM,ACTION_TOOLTIP,ASTEROID,PLANET,SHIP_SYSTEM,FACTION,TERRAIN
elysium,FACTION,"An ancient, space-faring civilization with a distinctly elven appearance, the Elysium combine advanced biotechnology with spiritual traditions. Their ships, constructed from a self-healing, wooden-like living armor, excel in energy-based combat. The organic nature of their vessels makes them incompatible with conventional shield technology, though their remarkable regenerative capabilities compensate for this weakness.","The Elysium emerged from the Collapse relatively unscathed, having isolated themselves in two densely populated star systems. After centuries of isolation, recent resource depletion and population pressure have driven them to adopt an aggressive expansionist policy. Their belief in their biological and cultural superiority fuels their conviction that they alone are worthy stewards of the Sector. Their core worlds remain secretive and heavily defended, while their expeditionary fleets probe outward, bringing them into increasing conflict with other powers.",,,"Elysium faction description"
elys_starforgerepair,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Channels the ship's living armor's regenerative properties through a specialized projection system to repair the hull of nearby allied ships.
Automatically targets the most damaged allied ship within range.
Generates hard flux to repair hull.
